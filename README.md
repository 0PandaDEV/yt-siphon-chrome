# YT Siphon
This is a browser extensoin / add-on to redirect YouTube URLs to alternative frontends. The default configured alternative frontend is `piped.video` by you can easily change this by clicking on the extension's icon which opens the options page and there you can change the default frontend.

This extension adds the following functionality:
- If you have a YouTube video page opened and press `Alt+J` (can be changed in your browser settings), it opens the video page in the configured frontend.
- If you're browsing YouTube and you `Shift+Click` on a video, it opens the video page in the configured frontend in a new tab.

## Motivation
YouTube started cracking down on Ad Blocker usage, so this is my workaround.
